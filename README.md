A demo of yaw and pitch tracking using the PhyPhox app.

## Getting started
You'll need to host a local server in order for the demo to work correctly.
Any server that can serve static files will do (eg. php-cli).

Unfortunately, the PhyPhox remote interface does not allow CORS, meaning that requests will be blocked by your browser.
In chromium-based browsers, the easiest way to deal with this is to install this plugin: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf?hl=en
